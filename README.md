Elm Blog Post Example
This repository contains an Elm application example that displays a simple blog post. The Elm architecture offers a robust framework for building web applications with a focus on reliability and maintainability.



Clone this repository or download the BlogPost.elm file.

Compiling the Code
To compile the Elm code to JavaScript:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing your BlogPost.elm file.
Run the following command: elm make BlogPost.elm --output=main.js
This will compile your Elm code into a JavaScript file named main.js.

Viewing Your Blog Post
After compiling your Elm code to JavaScript, you can view your blog post by including main.js in an HTML file. Here's a simple HTML template:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Your Blog Post</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="elm"></div>
    <script src="main.js"></script>
    <script>
        var app = Elm.BlogPost.init({
            node: document.getElementById('elm')
        });
    </script>
</body>
